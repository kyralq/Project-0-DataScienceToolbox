## Description

Project 0 : Data Review. In this project, we've found and reviewed data sources providing EDA techniques and code on a wide range of healthcare areas. Our goal is to find an interesting, rich dataset to explore more rigourously in Project 1 and to develop skills in data analysis and collaborative programming ahead of Project 1.
