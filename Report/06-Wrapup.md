## Conclusion

In this file we have each written a short conclusion about the datasets we worked on with the idea of comparing them so we are eventually able to select one to work with for the assessed coursework 1. 

### Nadia: 
The medications dataset I worked with required quite a lot of pre-processing to use it to perform the correlation analysis which was the aim of the code I downloaded. It was also potentially a bit small and has less of a clear purpose for a model trained on it. Whereas the stroke data could clearly be (and in many cases that I examined was) used for predicting how likely a patient is to have a stroke based on the factors in the data so I think this dataset should be a strong contender for use in project 1. 

### Kyra: 
The healthcare dataset I worked with isnâ€™t suitable for project 1 as it is synthetic however the code displayed some useful analyses to inspire work in the project. The covid dataset I worked with is very large with many factors across socio-economic areas. The case/ death rates could be a potential data test for exploration. 

### Neva: 
The cardiovascular disease dataset I worked with was good to run regression on and was very useable in the sense that the tidying up of the data was straightforward and it was clear to see why a logistic regression model was appropriate for the data. Hence this dataset would be a good option for use in project 1.
